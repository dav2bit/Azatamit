During my styuding pursuits, I embarked on the development of an extensive project titled "Azatamit."
Constructed primarily using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the backend infrastructure is powered by
Node.js and Express.



Key Features:



User Identification System:

Azatamit boasts a sophisticated user authentication system, allowing individuals to register, log in, and
create personalized accounts. This robust feature lays the foundation for a secure and personalized user
experience.



CRUD Operations for Posts and Courses:

The project incorporates a fully functional Content Management System (CMS) that facilitates Create,
Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for both publications and courses. This empowers users to
seamlessly manage and share their content within the platform.



Light Mode:

Elevating the user experience, Azatamit features a Light Mode. Users have the flexibility to toggle
between light and dark modes, providing a visually customizable interface to cater to individual
preferences.



Real-Time Chat Group:

Azatamit includes a real-time chat group using Socket.io, fostering instant communication and
collaboration between users. This dynamic feature adds a social element to the platform, enabling users
to connect and discuss various topics seamlessly.
